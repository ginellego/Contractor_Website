# Contractor_Website
This website is a platform for home renovators and project managers that are looking for local contractors for various services. It allows user to post updates on their projects, rate contractors, search for contractors, and contact or schedule consults with contractors. 

This was originally a project for the COMP 3010 course at the University of Manitoba, but has since been modified to include my personal additions. 

## Starting the program
The landing page for the website is the Login page. Open the login.html file to simulate the website locally.
